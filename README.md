15 Given an array arr[] and an integer K and integer N where K&N are smaller than
the size of the array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element and Nth largest
element in the given array. and find sum of that two values...N = 6
Input : arr[ ] = 7 10 4 3 20 15 K = 3 N = 2
Output : 7+15=22

16 You are given a large integer represented as an integer array of digits, where
each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most
significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not
contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
Example 1:
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
Example 2:
Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
Example 3:
Input: digits = [0]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 0.
Incrementing by one gives 0 + 1 = 1.
Thus, the result should be [1].
Example 4:
Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

17 Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except
for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear run time complexity and use only
constant extra space.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

18 Print the 7up element in the given array
An element in an array is 7up if its previous element is divisible by 7. The first
element in the array is always a 7up element.
Sample Input 1:
Enter the array size : 6
Input : 16 17 49 3 77 21
Output : 16 3 21
Explanation : 16 is the first element. Previous element to 3, 49 is divisible by 7.
Similarly previous element to 21, 77 is divisible by 7.
Sample Input 2:
Enter the array size : 5
Input : 1 0 7 14 21
Output : 1 7 14 21
Sample Input 3:
Enter the array size : 8
Input : 18 21 32 49 17 1 35 5
Output : 18 32 17 5

19 Local Minima Given an array of size n, find all local minima in the array Hint: A
local minimum of an array is an element which is less than or equal to both of its
neighbours
Sample Case 1:
Input:
Enter the array size: 7
Enter the elements: 9 6 2 14 5 7 4
Output:
Local Minima: 2 5 4
Explanation: 2 is less than 6 & 14 & so onSample Case 2:
Input:
Enter the array size: 9
Enter the elements: -1 3 -7 8 2 3 4 0 12
Output:
Local Minima: 1 -7 2 0
Sample Case 3:
Input:
Enter the array size: 4
Enter the elements: 7 1 1 4
Output:
Local Minima: 1 1

20 Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find
a contiguous sub array which adds to a given number S.
Example 1:
Input: N = 5, S = 12
A[ ] = {1,2,3,7,5}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: The sum of elements from 2nd position to 4th position is 12
Example 2:
Input: N = 10, S = 15
A[ ] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
Output: 1 5
Explanation: The sum of elements from 1st position to 5th position is 15
